# Little bit of info..
For more info go to the [Google Hacking Data-Base (GHDB)](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database) (NOT ownd by google). <br />
This is google dorking.
 Also there are things like [Us phone book](https://usphonebook.com). <br />
# Main part
Data leaks are bad and they are common, if you google: "(Last name)" site:github.com <br />
it will show some data, and this is bad, but you can protect your self with <br />
things like [VPNs](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=VPNs). 
As you know I'm 11, at least at the time of making this so I need <br />
to stay prtected.
